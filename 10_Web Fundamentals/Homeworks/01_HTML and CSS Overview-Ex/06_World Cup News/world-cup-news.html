            The biggest scoreline in the history of the <strong>Fifa WORLD Cup</strong> qualifiers &ndash;
            and indeed in the history of international football &ndash; was recorded on 11 april 2001,
            when australia beet american Samoa 31&ndash;0.
        </p>
        <p>
            This legendary match also brought global renown for <em>Archie Thompson</em>, whose 13&ndash;goal
            haul set a new world record, which stands to this day, for an individual player in a single
            international match.
        </p>
        <p>
            And though the defeat earned American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has their subsequent recovery
            been that it is now the subject of an acclaimed documentary, <em>&apos;Next Goal Wins&apos;</em>,
            showing across the world.
